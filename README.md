=========================
1. Deploying on Heroku is very simple for RoR applications. There is a lot of doccumentation in the in the internet.
2. Interaction between views and controller was a bit tricky.I had to try out some trial and error techniques to figure out the solution.
3. MongoLabs does not  support for older versions of mongo db. I had some issues uploading the data.
